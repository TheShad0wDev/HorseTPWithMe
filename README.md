Features:

Vehicle Teleportation
From horses to arrows, if you teleport anywhere while riding a mob or any other entity, your 'vehicle' will teleport with you.

Passenger Teleportation
If you have any passengers in your vehicle with you, such as a pig in a boat, those passengers will also teleport with you and remain in the vehicle.

Leash Teleportation
If you're holding any mob on a lead, they will teleport with you.

Installation & Setup:

Step 1: Simply put the HorseTpWithMe-XXXX.jar into you servers' plugins folder, then restart your server.
If all you want is a simple 'plug-and-play' setup, then that's it. The plugin is installed and setup.

Step 2 (Permissions): By default, every player has access to horsetpwithme.default meaning they can teleport any entity without restriction. If you want to choose which entities a player can teleport, which methods they can use and which worlds are available to them, you'll first need to revoke this permission and then add all of the specific entity permissions you want.

Permissions:
horsetpwithme.default - Teleport any entity in any world by any method; Vehicle, Passenger or Lead. This permission is granted to everyone by default.
horsetpwithme.teleport.* - Allows a player to teleport any entity type as a vehicle, as a passenger or on a lead.
